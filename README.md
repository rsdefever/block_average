# block_average
Implement the block averaging procedure of Flyvbjerg and Peterson

A simple repository that performs block averaging. Based upon the method from:

H. Flyvbjerg and H.G. Peterson. Error estimates on averages of correlated data. J. Chem. Phys. 91:461-466, 1989.

The method is described in Appendix D.3 of Frenkel and Smit (Understanding Molecular Simulation).

Installation:

    git clone git@github.com:rsdefever/block_average.git
    cd block_average/
    pip install .
  
Usage:

    from block_average import block_average
    help(block_average)
